Ryan Bates Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


Installation

  git clone git://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install
  # edit ~/.gitconfig and personalize it


Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with 
minor fiddling. I primarily use zsh, but this includes some older bash 
files as well. If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with 
the following command.

  chsh -s /bin/zsh


Features

I normally place all of my coding projects in ~/code, so this directory 
can easily be accessed (and tab completed) with the "c" command.

  c railsca<tab>

There is also an "h" command which behaves similar, but acts on the 
home path.

  h doc<tab>

Tab completion is also added to rake and cap commands:

  rake db:mi<tab>
  cap de<tab>

To speed things up, the results are cached in local .rake_tasks~ and 
.cap_tasks~. It is smart enough to expire the cache automatically in 
most cases, but you can simply remove the files to flush the cache.

There are a few key bindings set. Many of these require option to be
set as the meta key. Option-left/right arrow will move cursor by word, 
and control-left/right will move to beginning and end of line. 
Control-option-N will open a new tab with the current directory under
Mac OS X Terminal.

If you're using git, you'll notice the current branch name shows up in
the prompt while in a git repository.

If you're using Rails, you'll find some handy aliases (below). You can 
also use show_log and hide_log in script/console to show the log inline.
  
  ss       # script/server
  sc       # script/console
  sg       # script/generate
  a        # autotest
  tlog     # tail -f log/development.log
  rst      # touch tmp/restart.txt
  migrate  # rake db:migrate db:test:clone
  scaffold # script/generate nifty_scaffold
