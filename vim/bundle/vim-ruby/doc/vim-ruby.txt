3. Access modifier indentation		|ruby-access-modifier-indentation|


==============================================================================
1. Ruby motions						*ruby-motion*

Vim provides motions such as |[m| and |]m| for jumping to the start or end of
a method definition. Out of the box, these work for curly-bracket languages,
but not for ruby. The |vim-ruby| plugin enhances these motions, by making them
also work on ruby files.

							*ruby-]m*
]m			Go to start of next method definition.

							*ruby-]M*
]M			Go to end of next method definition.

							*ruby-[m*
[m			Go to start of previous method definition.

							*ruby-[M*
[M			Go to end of previous method definition.

							*ruby-]]*
]]			Go to start of next module or class definition.

							*ruby-][*
][			Go to end of next module or class definition.

							*ruby-[[*
[[			Go to start of previous module or class definition.

							*ruby-[]*
[]			Go to end of previous module or class definition.

==============================================================================
2. Ruby text objects					*ruby-text-objects*

Vim's |text-objects| can be used to select or operate upon regions of text
that are defined by structure. The |vim-ruby| plugin adds text objects for
operating on methods and classes.

							*ruby-v_am* *ruby-am*
am			"a method", select from "def" until matching "end"
			keyword.

							*ruby-v_im* *ruby-im*
im			"inner method", select contents of "def"/"end" block,
			excluding the "def" and "end" themselves.

							*ruby-v_aM* *ruby-aM*
aM			"a class", select from "class" until matching "end"
			keyword.

							*ruby-v_iM* *ruby-iM*
iM			"inner class", select contents of "class"/"end"
			block, excluding the "class" and "end" themselves.

3. Access modifier indentation             *ruby-access-modifier-indentation*
                                           *g:ruby_indent_access_modifier_style*

Different access modifier indentation styles can be used by setting: >

	:let g:ruby_indent_access_modifier_style = 'normal'
	:let g:ruby_indent_access_modifier_style = 'indent'
	:let g:ruby_indent_access_modifier_style = 'outdent'
<
By default, the "normal" access modifier style is used.

Access modifier style "normal":
>
  class Indent
    private :method
    protected :method
    private
    def method; end
    protected
    def method; end
    public
    def method; end
  end
<
Access modifier style "indent":
>
  class Indent
    private :method
    protected :method
    private
      def method; end
    protected
      def method; end
    public
    def method; end
  end
<
Access modifier style "outdent":
>
  class Indent
    private :method
    protected :method
  private
    def method; end
  protected
    def method; end
  public
    def method; end
  end
